# Pandas Exercises: Udemy Course

Welcome to my repository! This repo is dedicated to tracking my progress as I solve **100+ Pandas exercises** while taking a Pandas-focused Udemy course.

## About the Course
The course provides hands-on exercises that cover a wide range of topics in **Pandas**, including:
- DataFrame manipulation
- Grouping and aggregation
- Handling missing data
- Data visualization
- Time series data
- Merging and concatenating datasets

## Structure
Each exercise is solved on **Google Colab**, with solutions and explanations documented for each task.

- `exercises/`: Contains individual `.ipynb` files for each exercise.
- `data/`: Datasets used for exercises (if applicable).

## Objectives
- Strengthen my knowledge of Pandas library.
- Improve my ability to work with dataframes in Python.
- Track my learning and share my solutions.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JanaKassab/pandas-exercises-udemy.git
   ```
2. Open the exercise notebook you're interested in:
   - Each notebook is standalone and focuses on a specific Pandas concept or operation.
3. Run the exercises on **Google Colab** or your local environment.

## Progress
I'll be updating the repository regularly as I complete more exercises. Check back for new additions!
